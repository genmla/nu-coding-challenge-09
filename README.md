# README Maker

## Description

This project makes a README.md file based off of a README template and on responses given by the user. It is a class assignment that is meant to test our knowledge in using node to create prompts and write files based off of user input.

## Installation

The user should install the inquierer package which is included in the repo code, navigate to the code in the command line, type "npm i" and it should populate the required packages for to run the prompts. Then, when the inquirer package is downloaded, the user should be able to run the index.js file with "node index.js" in the command line. That should initialize the app. The user can then answer the prompts according to their application, and it will generate the README file once all prompts are entered.

## Usage

The user can use this applicaiton to make custom README files based on a template provided by the app and based on the answers the use provides in the  prompted questions.
